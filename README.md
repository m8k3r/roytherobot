Roy the Robot Arduino Code

The code used to create these scripts has come from example scripts included with the associated libraries, along with scriptes created by M8k3r to support the control of Roy the Robot.  All attribution is included in the library files, but not in the test scripts provided.  Outside of the manipulation of example code provided with the libraries to make Roy move properly, all attribution and software restrictions are included in the libraries and must be honored.  Most all of the example scripts that have been modified were originally written by Limor Fried/Ladyada for Adafruit Industries.
